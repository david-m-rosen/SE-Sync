function [y, lambda] = hessianextreme(problem, x, side, y0, options, storedb, key)
% Compute an extreme eigenvector / eigenvalue of the Hessian of a problem.

% [u, lambda] = hessianextreme(problem, x)
% [u, lambda] = hessianextreme(problem, x, side)
% [u, lambda] = hessianextreme(problem, x, side, u0)
% [u, lambda] = hessianextreme(problem, x, side, u0, options)
% [u, lambda] = hessianextreme(problem, x, side, u0, options, storedb)

% (For side, u0 and options, pass [] to omit any.)
%
% Given a Manopt problem structure and a point x on the manifold problem.M,
% this function computes a tangent vector u at x of unit norm such that the
% Hessian quadratic form is minimized or maximized:
%
%    minimize or maximize <u, Hess f(x)[u]> such that <u, u> = 1,
%
% where <.,.> is the Riemannian metric on the tangent space at x. Choose
% between minimizing and maximizing by setting side = 'min' or 'max', with
% 'min' being the default. The value attained is returned as lambda, and
% is the minimal or maximal eigenvalue of the Hessian (actually, the last
% value attained when the solver stopped). This is a real number since the
% Hessian is a symmetric operator.
%
% If u0 is specified, it should be a unit-norm tangent vector at x. It is
% then used as initial guess to solve the above problem. Pass [] to omit.
%
% The options structure, if provided, will be passed along to manoptsolve.
% As such, you may choose which solver to use to solve the above
% optimization problem by setting options.solver. See manoptsolve's help.
% The other options will be passed along to the chosen solver too.
% Pass [] to omit.
%
% Often times, it is only necessary to compute a vector u such that the
% quadratic form is negative, if that is at all possible. To do so, set the
% following stopping criterion: options.tolcost = -1e-10; (for example)
% and side = 'min'. The solver will return as soon as the quadratic cost
% defined above drops below the set value (or sooner if another stopping
% criterion triggers first.)
%
% storedb is a StoreDB object, key is the StoreDB key to point x.

%   April 3, 2015 (NB):
%       Works with the new StoreDB class system.
%
%   May 7, 2015 (NB):
%       Default solver options: verbosity = 0 and defaults to trustregions.

    % We define a manifold that is actually the unit sphere on the tangent
    % space to problem.M at x. A generalization would be to consider
    % Stiefel or Grassmann on the tangent space, but this would require
    % manipulating collections of tangent vectors, which in full generality
    % may be more complex (from a programming point of view).
    % Points are represented as tangent vectors of unit norm.
    % Tangent vectors are represented as tangent vectors orthogonal to the
    % root point, with respect to the Riemannian metric on the tangent
    % space.

    % tangent vector to M at x. This is a typical Riemannian submanifold of
    % a Euclidean space, hence it is easy to describe in terms of the tools
    % available for M.
