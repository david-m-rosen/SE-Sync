function hessfun = approxhessianFD(problem, options)
% Hessian approx. fnctn handle based on finite differences of the gradient.
%
% function hessfun = approxhessianFD(problem)
% function hessfun = approxhessianFD(problem, options)
%
% Input:
%
% A Manopt problem structure (already containing the manifold and enough
% information to compute the cost gradient) and an options structure
% (optional), containing one option:
%    options.stepsize (positive double; default: 1e-4).
%
% If the gradient cannot be computed on 'problem', a warning is issued.
%
% Output:
% 
% Returns a function handle, encapsulating a generic finite difference
% approximation of the Hessian of the problem cost. The finite difference
% is based on computations of the gradient.
% 
% The returned hessfun has this calling pattern:
% 
%   function hessfd = hessfun(x, xdot)
%   function hessfd = hessfun(x, xdot, storedb)
%   function hessfd = hessfun(x, xdot, storedb, key)
% 
% x is a point on the manifold problem.M, xdot is a tangent vector to that
% manifold at x, storedb is a StoreDB object, and key is the StoreDB key to
% point x.
%
% Usage:
%
% Typically, the user will set problem.M and other fields to define the
% cost and the gradient (typically, problem.cost and problem.grad or
% problem.egrad). Then, to use this generic purpose Hessian approximation:
%
%   problem.approxhess = approxhessianFD(problem, options);
%
% See also: trustregions

% The Riemannian Trust-Region method, used in combination with the present
% Hessian approximation, is called RTR-FD. Some convergence theory for it
% is available in this paper:

%   Feb. 19, 2015 (NB):
%       It is sufficient to ensure positive radial linearity to guarantee
%       (together with other assumptions) that this approximation of the
%       Hessian will confer global convergence to the trust-regions method.
%       Formerly, in-code comments referred to the necessity of having
%       complete radial linearity, and that this was harder to achieve.
%       This appears not to be necessary after all, which simplifies the
%       code.
%
%   April 3, 2015 (NB):
%       Works with the new StoreDB class system.
%
%   April 8, 2015 (NB):
%       Changed to approxhessianFD, which now returns a function handle
%       that encapsulates the getHessianFD functionality. Will be better
%       aligned with the other Hessian approximations to come (which may
%       want to use storedb.internal), and now allows specifying the step
%       size.

    % This Hessian approximation is based on the gradient:
    % check availability.
