% This example in based on the paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01437:
% ShapeFit: Exact location recovery from corrupted pairwise directions, 2015
% by Paul Hand, Choongbum Lee and Vladislav Voroninski.
%
% The problem is the following: there are n points t_1, ..., t_n in R^d
% which need to be estimated (localized). To this end, we are given
% measurements of some of the pairwise directions,
% v_ij = (t_i - t_j) / norm(t_i - t_j) + noise.
% Assume there are m such pairwise measurements, defining a graph with m
% edges over n nodes. J is the signed incidence matrix of this graph (see
% in code). To build J from lists I, J in R^m of nodes, use:
% J = sparse([I ; J], [(1:m)' ; (1:m)'], [ones(m, 1), -ones(m, 1)], n, m, 2*m);
%
% The measurements are arranged in the matrix V of size d x m. From V, we
% attempt to estimate t_1, ..., t_n, arranged in T, a matrix of size d x n.
% The estimation can only be done up to translation and scaling. The
% returned T's are centered: the columns sum to zero.
%
% ShapeFit is a formulation of this estimation problem which is robust to
% outliers. It is a nonsmooth, convex optimization problem over an affine
% space, i.e., a linear manifold. We smooth the cost using the pseudo-Huber
% loss cost and solve the problem using Manopt. This requires two
% ingredients: (1) a factory to describe the affine space, see
% shapefitfactory; (2) defining the cost and its derivative, and minimizing
% it while progressively tightening the smooth approximation (with
% warm-start).
%
% Simply run the example to see the results on random data. It compares the
% smoothed ShapeFit formulation against a least-squares formulation, when
% the measurements include outliers. See in code to vary the noise
% parameters, dimension d, number of nodes n, number of measurements m, ...
%
% Note: since the problem is convex, this returns the global optimum.
% This example also illustrates the use of Manopt for optimization under
% linear constraints: admittedly a simple subcase of optimization on
% manifolds.
