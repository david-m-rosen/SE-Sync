function M = sympositivedefinitefactory(n)
% Manifold of n-by-n symmetric positive definite matrices with
% the bi-invariant geometry.
%
% function M = sympositivedefinitefactory(n)
%
% A point X on the manifold is represented as a symmetric positive definite
% matrix X (nxn). Tangent vectors are symmetric matrices of the same size
% (but not necessarily definite).
%
% The Riemannian metric is the bi-invariant metric, described notably in
% Chapter 6 of the 2007 book "Positive definite matrices"
% by Rajendra Bhatia, Princeton University Press.
%
%
% The retraction / exponential map involves expm (the matrix exponential).
% If too large a vector is retracted / exponentiated (e.g., a solver tries
% to make too big a step), this may result in NaN's in the returned point,
% which most likely would lead to NaN's in the cost / gradient / ... and
% will result in failure of the optimization. For trustregions, this can be
% controlled by setting options.Delta0 and options.Delta_bar, to prevent
% too large steps.
%
%
% Note also that many of the functions involve solving linear systems in X
% (a point on the manifold), taking matrix exponentals and logarithms, etc.
% It could therefore be beneficial to do some precomputation on X (an
% eigenvalue decomposition for example) and store both X and the
% preprocessing in a structure. This would require modifying the present
% factory to work with such structures to represent both points and tangent
% vectors. We omit this in favor of simplicity, but it may be good to keep
% this in mind if efficiency becomes an issue in your application.

%       There were a number of mistakes in the code owing to the tacit
%       assumption that if X and eta are symmetric, then X\eta is
%       symmetric too, which is not the case. See discussion on the Manopt
%       forum started on Jan. 19, 2014. Functions norm, dist, exp and log
%       were modified accordingly. Furthermore, they only require matrix
%       inversion (as well as matrix log or matrix exp), not matrix square
%       roots or their inverse.
% 
%   July 28, 2014 (NB)
%       The dim() function returned n*(n-1)/2 instead of n*(n+1)/2.
%       Implemented proper parallel transport from Sra and Hosseini (not
%       used by default).
%       Also added symmetrization in exp and log (to be sure).
% 
%   April 3, 2015 (NB):
%       Replaced trace(A*B) by a faster equivalent that does not compute
%       the whole product A*B, for inner product, norm and distance.
